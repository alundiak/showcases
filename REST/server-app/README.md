CRUD REST-API server example
===

This folder is my basic idea how to represent "a REST API server application showcase" using `ExpressJS` server app with API tests relying on `supertest` and `jest`.

TBD
- Continue with Database integration using `sqlite`

Notes:

- It's VERY similar with another code setup I have related to HTTP methods, and how all can be used/implemented.
- But this repo concentrates ONLY specifically on REST paradigms.
