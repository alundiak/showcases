DDD - Domain-Driven Design
===

DDD is an approach to software development that

- focuses on understanding and modeling the domain of the business
- encourages collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders to create a shared understanding of the domain. 
- introduces concepts like `entities`, `value objects`, `bounded contexts`, `ubiquitous language`, `aggregates`, and `repositories` to model the domain in a way that reflects the real-world business processes.

## Concepts

- **bounded context** is a specific area within a larger system where a particular model or set of terms and definitions applies. It defines the explicit boundaries in which a certain set of concepts have specific and consistent meanings.
  - In a large and complex system, different parts of the system may have different models and understandings of certain concepts. Bounded contexts help manage this complexity by allowing different parts of the system to have their own distinct models without conflicting with each other.
- A **repository** provides an interface for querying and saving aggregates.
