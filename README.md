Showcase SOLID principles
===

TODO: 
- JS and TS implementation
- Visualized maybe?
- Maybe rename repo into `solid-patterns` and then represent showcases for SOLID and Design Patterns with code examples and visualization via CSS/HTML

Note. Initial code generated by ChatGPT. Then modified by me.

# SOLID info

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:

- Class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility or job.

Examples: 
- Good adherence to the SRP is the Spring Framework in the Java ecosystem (Spring MVC, Spring Data, Spring Boot)

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:

- Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Examples: 
- Good adherence: Hibernate. 
- jQuery's plugin architecture allows developers to extend its functionality by creating plugins. This follows the OCP by allowing extension without modifying jQuery's source code.
- Eclipse is built with a modular architecture, allowing developers to extend its functionality through plugins without modifying the core code.
- Django's class-based views and middleware architecture follow OCP. Developers can create custom middleware or views to extend behavior without modifying Django's core components.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

- Objects of a base class should be replaceable with objects of a derived class without affecting the correctness of the program. 
- This is achieved by ensuring that derived classes honor the contracts established by the base class.

Examples:

- Many JavaScript and TypeScript libraries adhere to LSP. For instance, various libraries for handling asynchronous operations (like Promises or Observables) allow you to interchangeably use different implementations without affecting the overall logic of your code.
- Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks like Spring (Java), Dagger (Java/Kotlin), and Angular (TypeScript) follow LSP. 
- In Java, the Collections Framework is a good example of LSP. Various collection types (e.g., List, Set, Map) implement common interfaces (e.g., Collection, List, Set, Map). 
This allows you to substitute different implementations without affecting the correctness of the code.
- In .NET, the LINQ (Language Integrated Query) extensions and the concept of IEnumerable demonstrate LSP.
- LSP is pervasive in object-oriented languages like Java, C#, and Python. Polymorphism, achieved through interfaces and inheritance, allows you to use objects of derived classes wherever base class objects are expected.

# Not SOLID info

- The Common Closure Principle (CCP) and Common Reuse Principle (CRP) are not part of the SOLID principles.
- CCP and CRP, on the other hand, are principles that emphasize the grouping of classes based on the commonality of reasons for change (CCP) and the idea that classes should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use (CRP). 

# SOLID via js

MAYBE

# SOLID via ts 

Look `*.ts` files code for more explanation of every SOLID rule.

## `tsc`

- `tsc --init` Creates a tsconfig.json with the recommended settings in the working directory.
- `tsc --init --target esnext --module esnext --lib esnext` 

- `tsc` builds all *.ts files into `dist` (because it's `outputDir` in `tsconfig.json`).
- `tsc -d` compiles with `*.d.ts` file.
- `tsc 1.srp.ts` compiles to `1.srp.js` but in "ugly" way.
- `tsc 1.srp.ts -d` compiles with `*.d.ts` file.

## `ts-node`

- `ts-node 1.srp.ts` execute TypeScript file/code in NodeJS ecosystem
