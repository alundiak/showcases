Showcases
===

Showcases for different Software Development topics with code examples to give an educational impression of how theoretical becomes practical.

My special angle is **JavaScript** which is functional programming language and as result many SOLID principles and Design patterns are not so relevant in JavaScript world. 

But since **TypeScript** appeared as superset after JavaScript, implementing more and more ECMAScript paradigms/features it becomes more Object Orienting approach. And now, some principles and patterns may apply and code can follow and be compliant.  


# Topics

There are many concepts, paradigms, principles related to software design, design and architectural patterns, rules and solutions.

# Note.

Initial code for many files is generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), but then I modified and extended to show real case scenarios.

# TODO 

- Visualized maybe?
- Find out some other topics.

# BTW, just a reminder

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) encourages the avoidance of duplicating code. Instead, reuse code through abstraction or encapsulation to reduce redundancy.

- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) promotes simplicity in design and implementation. Solutions should be as simple as possible to achieve the required functionality.

- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) advises against adding functionality until it is necessary. Avoid over-engineering by implementing only what is currently needed, rather than trying to anticipate future requirements.
