Software Development Showcases
===

Showcases for different Software Development topics with code examples to give an educational impression of how theoretical becomes practical.

# Topics

- SOLID principles => [README.md](./solid/README.md)
- Design Patterns => [README.md](./design-patterns/README.md)
- maybe AntiPatterns? => https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns

Special angle is JavaScript. JavaScript functional programming language and many SOLID principles and Design patterns are not so relevant in JavaScript world. But since TypeScript appeared as superset after JavaScript, implementing more and more ECMAScript paradigms/features it becomes more Object Orienting approach. And now, some principles and patterns may apply and code can follow and be compliant.  

# Note.

Initial code for many files is generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), but then I modified and extended to show real case scenarios.

# TODO 

- Visualized maybe?
- Find out some other topics.
