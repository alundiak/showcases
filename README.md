Software Development Showcases
===

Showcases for different Software Development topics with code examples to give an educational impression of how theoretical becomes practical.

My special angle is **JavaScript** which is functional programming language and as result many SOLID principles and Design patterns are not so relevant in JavaScript world. 

But since **TypeScript** appeared as superset after JavaScript, implementing more and more ECMAScript paradigms/features it becomes more Object Orienting approach. And now, some principles and patterns may apply and code can follow and be compliant.

# Note.

Initial code for many files is generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), but then I modified and extended to show real case scenarios.

# TODO 

- Visualized maybe?
- Find out some other topics.
