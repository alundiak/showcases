## Key notes about Design patterns

### Creational patterns

**Singleton**:

- The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the (SOLID) Single Responsibility Principle.
- The `Object.freeze()` method makes sure that consuming code cannot modify the Singleton. 
- are actually considered an anti-pattern, and can (or.. should) be avoided in JavaScript.
- Simple real case scenario example is [here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/singleton-1-64mr1) with two buttons using same Counter object.
- A Facade class can often be transformed into a Singleton since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.
- Flyweight would resemble Singleton if you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object.

**Prototype**:

- The Prototype pattern is very powerful when working with objects that should have access to the same properties. Instead of creating a duplicate of the property each time, we can simply add the property to the prototype, since all instances have access to the prototype object.
- Prototype pattern lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
- The value of `__proto__` on any instance of the constructor, is a direct reference to the constructorâ€™s `prototype`!
- The `Object.create()` method lets us create a new object, to which we can explicitly pass the value of its prototype


**Module**:

- The Module pattern allows you to split up your code into smaller, reusable pieces.
- ES2015 introduced built-in JavaScript modules.
