OOP
===

- **Encapsulation** refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class.
- **Inheritance** is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class.
- **Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.
